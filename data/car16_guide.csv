Participants in this interactive workshop should expect to go home with a set of promising ideas for algorithmic accountability stories."
A candid discussion on when and how data journalists disclose their methods,"While a data journalist's toolkit is becoming more and more complex, the responsibility to disclose and explain our methods remains a bit murky. How do we explain to a lay audience our usage of models or machine learning techniques? What if there is an error in a library we used to perform our analysis? What do readers need to understand about our techniques to properly interpret the results of our analysis? Should we publish source/raw data? These are a few of the questions we will raise and attempt to answer — with your help. Audience participation will be an important part of this session. Let's figure out some transparency best practices for data journalists."
Advanced data cleaning with Python: Machine learning techniques,"
People and corporations are of interest to reporters, but data about them are often messy. Fundamentally, natural language lacks structure and the same thing can be represented in many different ways. In many cases, simple deterministic approaches (e.g. regex) can't get you very far. We'll show you some of the powerful tools that DataMade uses to efficiently clean and link the worst data, including dedupe, usaddress, and probablepeople

Prereqs: Comfort with python"
Building VR interactives with Three.js,"Lights, camera, liftoff! In this session we'll learn how to create a three-dimensional virtual reality scene using Three.js and Mars terrain data from NASA. 

Using the L.A. Times's ""Discovering Gale Crater"" interactive, we'll walk you through how to import elevation data, turn a flat plane into a geographic surface, and map a terrain texture (basically a high-resolution photograph) onto that object. Then, we'll learn how to integrate controls for desktop and mobile devices, and how to use pre-existing elements to turn the 3D scene into a virtual reality experience.   

If time permits, we'll also brainstorm ways to improve current VR efforts, and how to lower the bar for implementing VR and 3D interactives in newsrooms. "
Lessons from a computational political scientist,"When reporters take on document analysis, we sometimes forget that content analysis has been a mainstay of political and other social sciences for generations. We'll learn about both traditional and cutting edge techniques from Amber Boydstun, a political scientist at the University of California at Davis whose projects include finding jokes in Federal Reserve meeting transcripts and media agenda-setting analysis."
PivotTables in Excel,"A look at the awesome power of pivot - and how to use it to analyze your dataset in minutes rather than hours.

This session will be most helpful if: You are familiar with formulas in Excel or another spreadsheet program."
Stats: Logistic regression,"Linear regression helps you find relationships between two or more variables, but when an outcome has only two possibilities, you need a different tool. That, my friends, is where logistic regression comes in.

This session will be most useful if: You took 'Stats: An introduction', or are comfortable with summary statistics and PSPP or SPSS. Familiarity with spreadsheets and database managers is recommended."
The value of emerging (and failed) tech,"Google Wave. Second Life. Yo! Google Glass. Is there value in developing on emerging technology, even though the tech may fail? In this #wjchat-style session, we’ll share the stories and lessons learned from early adoption. Bring your CueCat."
Visualization and analysis in Python,"So you know a bit of Python, you’ve scraped a site or two, and got some data with it. Now get quick insights out of that data by visualizing it right inside of Python. This course will teach you how to make quick exploratory charts using matplotlib, a powerful and versatile graphing library, using the handy iPython Notebook (Jupyter) environment. You’ll also learn how to export these charts to hand over to a designer or straight to publication.

Suggested experience: You should have some basic knowledge of programming, preferably in Python."
Web scraping without programming,"Web scraping without programming The data's there. But it's trapped in an unfriendly format. In this session, we'll show you how to use free and easy tools to liberate information from various formats common to the Web ( HTML, PDF, JSON, XML) and get it into a format more ideal for data analysis."

This session is ideal for folks with some Python experience, especially those who've reached the limits of what they can do with tools like csvkit, but find pandas and numpy bewildering."
Amazon cloud basics,"Cloud servers are an amazingly flexible way to use computing resources. Servers and test benches used to take weeks to order and configure, but thanks to the cloud, you can build up arbitrarily complex farms of computers to do your bidding in a few minutes, from serving a dynamic news app to crunching through a data set to trying out a new technology on the cheap. This course will help you understand the thicket of acronyms and programs that make up Amazon's AWS system and will get you started building servers.

All you need is a normal Amazon account. Before the class, go to http://aws.amazon.com/ and click ""sign up,"" and follow the instructions so you've got an account ready. Important note: We'll build actual servers and then turn them off, which may cost a few dollars."
Conversations: Meaningful metrics for journalism (Sponsored by SRCCON),"What's success in journalism? From the perspective of the end user, the journalist, the news organization, the industry. Are these very different definitions? Are they hard/easy to assess? * Is every piece of journalism comparable to another piece of journalism? Are there metrics used to determine success/performance for a piece of journalism applicable to all formats of storytelling? * What metrics are you using today and what do they tell you? * What are things you want to know but have no answers to because there are no ways to measures the answer? * What metrics (measures and indicators) are used in your work setting; which ones make sense and why, and how some can be inappropriate/misleading. * What tools/sources do you use to access metrics? How do they fit with your workflow?"
"Data viz for all: Creating interactive experiences that are usable, accessible, and mobile-friendly","We hear a lot of the following during discussions about creating mobile-friendly data-driven experiences: “It’s not possible to make good interactives on mobile.” “It’ll hurt our work on desktop.” “It’s not worth the effort.” “It’s too hard.” One thing is true: Making a news app work well on mobile requires different methodology than is commonly utilized today – but that doesn’t necessarily mean a worse process or an inferior product. In fact, mobile-friendly interactives better serve news audiences, and creating these experiences is possible (and practical!) to do. This session will teach attendees how to better present and share data-driven content on the mobile web. We'll cover the best practices for developing mobile-friendly, accessible data visualizations, which will help news application designers and developers create interactive graphics that work universally and are accessible via assistive technologies like screen readers."
Deep dives: Broadcast,"From government records to stats you compile yourself -- data plays a major part in journalism. But how do you make those digits, figures and records come to life on TV? Veteran journalists walk you through the process that makes their data-driven stories sing."
Detecting deception: The language of lies,"Let's face it: people lie. We lie to each other and to ourselves. How is the rewiring of communication in the digital revolution changing how we lie? How can we trust that online review, or that text message about someone being on their way? We’ll discuss the state-of-the-art in deception detection research on how to spot a liar online, explore some new forms of deception, and examine how different technologies affect both how we lie and how we trust online. Jeff Hancock will share key principles that can guide how we can think about deception and truth in this new digital age and how we can use this knowledge as journalists."

Learn about what champions for open data working with or within government agencies have accomplished so far, what they're excited about, and what things (big and small) journalists can do to help improve open data."
Can't afford your own unicorn? Bringing civic hackers into the newsroom,"Let’s face it, most of us work at media houses that are never going to have a full data team. But we have plenty of evidence from around the world that there is another way! Millions of dollars are being poured into the development of tech hubs, open data portals and data-driven think tanks, all of which are collecting fabulous data, building apps and finding amazing stories, none of which ever reach the public. In this session, the people who have created new models for bringing together civic hackers and under-resourced newsrooms to collaborate on data-driven projects will share what it takes to make these partnerships work and evaluate their impact on the public and the media."
Conversations: How should news apps teams respond to the era of distributed news? (Sponsored by SRCCON),"What's the role of a news apps team in a world of Facebook Instant Articles, Apple News and Snapchat stories? As tech companies build bespoke platforms for publishing the news -- and as audiences shift towards those platforms -- how should news apps teams respond? Is digital journalism that is published solely or primarily on media companies' own platforms now 'legacy' media? More personally, are mid-career digital journalists at risk if they don't adapt quickly to this new environment, and develop another set of skills around off-platform publishing?"
Counting & summing with SQL,"If you know how to write a basic SELECT statement in SQL but are looking to make calculations, then this is the session for you.

"Conversations: Investing in news, how do you ask for money? (Sponsored by SRCCON)","We're good at selling our stories, but crafting grant applications, strategizing pitch decks and talking cash involves different muscles. How do you ask for money to pay for your news projects / startups? What works? What have you learned to avoid? What are the unspoken rules — for example, grants may lay out requirements publicly, but what else is helpful to know about how your application will be evaluated?"
Finding insights in connected data: Using graph databases in journalism,"When dealing with datasets, journalists have many options to choose from when moving beyond Excel. Usually the first step is using a relational (or SQL) database. While a relational database can be a good choice for some datasets, data analysts today turn to new tools to gain deeper insight. This talk will show how we can use a graph database to analyze highly connected data using examples from U.S. Congressional data and political email archives. Using the U.S. Congress data, we’ll show you how to explore the dataset using Cypher, the Neo4j query language, to discover legislator activity including bill sponsorship and voting activity. Building up our knowledge of Cypher as we progress, we’ll show how you can use principles from social network analysis to find influential legislators and discover what topics legislators have influence over. Finally, we will examine how to draw insights from the Hillary Clinton email dataset, released as part of a FOIA request earlier this year. We will explore this dataset as a graph of interactions among users, answering questions like: Who is communicating with Hillary the most? What are the topics of these emails? You’ll learn how to visualize these using the Neo4j browser to quickly make sense of the data as we are exploring.

The goal of this talk is to provide a demonstration of database tools that any journalist can use to explore datasets and draw insights from connected datasets."

Come learn a concrete financial analysis skill and how to apply it to a public pension plan near you."
How to keep up: Newsapps teams as lifetime learners,"It’s the great newsroom double bind: keep up with new technologies or risk becoming obsolete,. but do it while keeping up your day job (which takes all your time). If everyone in the newsroom feels this pressure, the news apps developers and CAR reporters who thrive on being the cool kids on the bleeding edge can feel it even more keenly. In this session, we'll consider some of the methods we use as individuals and as teams to overcome this challenge and build an environment that fosters continuous learning. A few questions we'll consider: How do I continuously hone my chops and keep current with changing technology if that’s not the only thing I do with my time? What strategies have individuals and teams developed that build learning into their workflows and routines? How can editors help create a team culture that supports learning and experimentation without sacrificing productivity? And how can these lessons be applied more broadly to help less technically minded reporters catch up and keep up?"
Humanizing numbers,"Data helps you tell your story, yet for journalists, the most important work remains the human story and giving insight into individuals.

Conversations: Let's talk leadership (Sponsored by SRCCON),"There are lots of different ways to be a leader in your organization, no matter what your title is. So what does it take to be a good one? A few questions: What leadership skills and characteristics have been undervalued? How do we get better representation in leadership roles? What's the right amount of process for a dev/data team? What keeps a team happy and healthy? What *doesn't* work? What can current managers do to support the next generation of newsroom leaders? Who's the best boss you've ever had and what made them great? This conversation could be geared toward people who are curious about leadership, or current managers who want to swap best practices and words of warning. Ideally a mix of both."
Getting your feet wet: Data projects you can try anywhere,"Two reporters who have worked in cities across the U.S. (Dubuque, Boise, Milwaukee and San Diego, to name a few) will walk you through short-term, data-driven investigations you can take home to your coverage area.

When correlation is causation,"Is red meat bad for your health? What's a triple-blind clinical trial? Are the Finnish really that great at mathematics? What's so significant about statistical significance? During the first half of this workshop, you'll get acquainted with concepts like confounding, selection bias, Simpson's paradox, randomization and statistical power. In the second half, it's up to you: judge your way through a series of small case studies and practice what you've learned. It's not enough to say that correlation does not imply causation. Learn exactly what stands in the way of drawing truthful conclusions from data, how to recognize great science and how to spot the flaws that invalidate statistical conclusions."
Teaching Data and Computational Journalism - Report Launch at NICAR 2016,"
We are pleased to announce the launch of ""Teaching Data and Computational Journalism"" at this year's NICAR conference in Denver.

This report is the culmination of a year-long collaboration between researchers at Columbia and Stanford that was funded by the Knight Foundation.

We have surveyed the level of instruction in data and computational skills at US journalism schools, observed classes, and interviewed dozens of data journalists and journalism instructors to better understand the pedagogical landscape and best practices in this field. The report also offers a set of model curricula to assist journalism educators in developing broader course offerings in data and computation.

So if you will be at NICAR this year, please come out on Saturday, March 12th at 6pm to pick up a hard copy of our report and enjoy a few drinks on us. This event will be held at the conference hotel, the Denver Marriott City Center, in Colorado G-J, located on lower level 2."
